## Full React implementation
<b>Have any feedback or requests regarding new things to implement? [issues](https://github.com/VolodymyrPliuta/React-state/issues)</b>

I am thinking about moving parts of application into seperate repos, because project getting too large.

This project is all about implementing various parts of react in a single project.

everything broken out into its own component.




first pass properties
then state as a property
then properties as function

Then passed properties from grandfather to father and from father to child. (to be double checked)
Jest testing.



functional component vs class component... -extends component . class component has state. 

react router
implemented router two different ways
router with render method and router without render method

Things to do or failed implementation
service worker. - alot of people do not like because of seurity issues.
